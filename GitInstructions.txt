<h> BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </h>
Commit your changes to your local branch

from communityApp (NOT communityApp/CommunityApp)!!!!!!!!!!!!!
git add *;
git commit -m "my message";

Pull the changes from the origin into your local branch
Check if you have origin configured
git remote -v; (you should see an upstream)

git fetch upstream;
git merge upstream/master;

Resolve any conflicts. If you have to do this, commit again

THEN
git push origin/master


THEN
give me a pull request on github






If you mess things up revert to last commit with git reset --hard
